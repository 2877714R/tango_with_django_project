# tango_with_django_project

Please note that I only realised exercised were required when I had already started chapter 4; thus the early chapters are all combined into one large commit. I then went back and checked what I had done with the previous tests and they all passed however I had not committed after I reverted the changes and tested.
Furthermore, for chapter 5 tests there is an issue with the way it reads the rango picture and the cat picture. I have tried many things to fix this however I have heard many other people were struggling with this issue.
